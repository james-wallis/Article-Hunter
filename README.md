# Article-Hunter

## Purpose
* Article Hunter has been designed to assist developers when trying to expand their product usage.
* It trawls through the first 100 results on Stack Overflow using their API and using a set of user provided key words, will display to the users articles which contain the keywords that they have entered. Using this the user can engage in a discussion and help fix queries about their product whilst also advertising it and expanding its user base.
* In the future it will support more API's for forums and basic RSS feed trawling.

## Features
* Currently Article Hunter only has the basic features of reading through the first page of Stack Overflow and after checking through the
Title, Body and Tags of a post, it will display a list of relevant articles that have matched with any keyword set.

Start the server by typing:

  ```bash
  npm run hunter
  ```
